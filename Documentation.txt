Jason Noone - Documentation of Asteroids

My ship starts off at the center of the screen and moves and turns as such when the arrow keys are pressed.
It accelerates when moving forward and decelerates when not moving (If the code works).

The asteroids are randomly generated; there are three different images for it to randomly choose from for both small and large asteroids, they move 
in random directions, and the large asteroids start in random positions. Once they collide with something (either the player or the bullet) the 
large asteroids break into 3 small asteroids.

The spacebar fires bullets in the direction the ship is facing and they don't fire like a machine gun.

The collisions work. The asteroids break when hit, the bullets dissapear when they hit an asteroid, and the player looses a life when they collide 
with an asteroid.

My "above and beyond" is that, I like to think, that my graphics are well designed (drawn by myself) and lead to a consistent theme. However I could 
not get a second above and beyond in there due to time constraints.
